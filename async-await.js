/*
 Blocking code vs Non-blocking code


Blocking code:
- Blocking code is synchronous code that blocks the execution of code until the operation completes.  --> Read file synchronously
Non-blocking code:
- Non-blocking code is asynchronous code that doesn't block the execution of code. --> Read file asynchronously
